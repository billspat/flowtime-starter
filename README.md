flowtime-starter
================

This is a very basic starter project for building [flowtime.js](http://flowtime-js.marcolago.com) presentations with html.

Motivation
----------

Flowtime is a fantastic javascript presentation framework.  The code is very clear and easy to use, however the project contains both the main demo presentation, the images from that demo, two places for assets, and extra examples.  The project contains a bower.js file but using 'bower install flowtime' installs the entire project, including all of the demonstration files (html, imgs, doc etc) instead of just the assets.   

This Project
------------

This project simply re-organizes the original flowtime.js project to collect all the assets and provide a couple simple example html files.   It's a crude cut/paste of the flowtime.js repo from December 2014 and has no sophisticated connection or build from the flowtime.js repo github (e.g. submodules).    CSS files are CSS and not SASS, etc.

For more examples, please see the 'examples' folder in [https://github.com/marcolago/flowtime.js](https://github.com/marcolago/flowtime.js)

You may want to use the yoeman based https://github.com/sasaplus1/generator-flowtime which looks like a better way to proceed but that I couldn't get to work.
